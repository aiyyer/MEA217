## About

This course introduces students in the geosciences to fundamental coding concepts using Python. Beginning with problem-solving in the Karel programming environment, students will build a strong foundation in computational thinking before transitioning to Python programming. Applications to geoscience data analysis, visualization, and modeling will be emphasized.


## Lecture
Each lecture will first introduce a coding concept (first 20-30 minutes). Then, the class will be invited to work on a coding excercise.
