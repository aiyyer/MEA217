- Download the file [numpy_practice.ipynb](numpy_practice.ipynb) and work through the examples and exercises based on numpy arrays
- upload the file on moodle (see assignment link for today on moodle)


## Activity 2: Identify and acquire a geophysical data/time series
- Identify and download any geophysical data that interests you
- For example, a time series of temperature at Raleigh, a long-term time series of CO2 measurement from Mauna Loa, Salinity data from a buoy, seismicity data from a station. 
- Save the data on your computer, show me the saved data, and also upload it on moodle 

## Activity 3: Introduction to Pandas - Reading Activity (approx 30 minutes)
- Navigate to [https://wesmckinney.com/book/pandas-basics](https://wesmckinney.com/book/pandas-basics) and read section 5.1
- Try out code snippets to get familiar with Pandas. This will take time to get familiar. So, patience is key
- Download the file [pandas_introduction.ipynb](pandas_introduction.ipynb) and work through the sections. Finally, attempt the exercise in this file. Questions? Ask me
- upload the file with your solution on moodle
