At this point we have been introduced to several basic concepts related to Pandas. These include
 - importing pandas
 - reading csv files
 - performingv basic statsistcis with column data
 - grouping data
 - simple visualization

Now we will be learn some more basic operations with Pandas so that we can perform more sophisticated 
exploratory data analysis.

Today, we will following along a presentation (on youtube) and do some basic data explaoration online. The platform that we 
will use is called kaggle and it is very similar to jupyter notebook.


## Activity 1
- Get an account (free) on kaggle. According to google:

"Kaggle is an online community and platform for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.
It is known for its machine learning competitions but also provides a range of resources for 
learning and collaboration."

- Navigate to https://www.kaggle.com/
- Follow instructions to make an account and log on to your account

  
## Activity 2

- Familiarize with working in kaggle and reading a sample data file by viewing and following along with this presentation
  [Getting Started on Kaggle: Writing code to analyze a dataset | Kaggle ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvF2H85ko9c&list=PLqFaTIg4myu8gbDh6oBl7XRYNBlthpDEW&index=10)
  

## Activity 3: Pandas for data analysis
- Follow along the presentation [Learning Pandas for Data Analysis? Start Here](https://youtu.be/DkjCaAMBGWM?si=3tVnODD9V28CyuBV)
  **Note** You may have trouble locating the data file used in the presentation. For now, just view
  the presentation and take notes on pandas capabilities. We will review this next class.


## Activity 4: Quick intro to correlation and regressions
In preperation for a deeper dive into data analysis, please familiarize yourself with the basic ideas of correlation and regression by viewing:

- [ Linear Regression in 2 minutes ](https://youtu.be/CtsRRUddV2s?si=FCkapw9wL_9p0xTy)
- [Correlation and Coefficient of Determination in 3 Minutes](https://youtu.be/rijqfllOq6g?si=XSMagqCl3jDIY3Sj)
