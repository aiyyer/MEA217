Today, we will build on the concepts from previous class and perform an exploratory data analysis with 
some new datasets


## Activity 1
- Download the data file: "Earthquakes-1990-2023.csv" from moodle (look under data and code section).
- Write code to use pandas to read the dataset into a data frame
- Examine the contents of the dataframe and answer the questions
    - How many columns are there?
    - How many rows are there?
    - How often was an earthquake recorded at each state (or country)?
    - How many instances of magnitude exceeding 5 occur during this period (globally)?
 

## Activity 2
  - We will write additional code to perform more analysis and visualization. Follow along with me in 
  class
  
## Activity 3
    - Upload your code on moodle for credit for today's in class activity
