## Activity 1

At this point we have been introduced to several concepts - loops, arrays, numpy oprations and are ready for pandas. I would like to use this class (or at least part of it) to answer your questions. 

To motivate the dicsussion, I would like you to work on the following 

- write code to create an array of 10 numbers
- loop over the array elements and pringt each number
- write a function to create the sum of all 10 numbers


## Activity 2 (continued from last class)

- Download [pandas example](pandas_example.ipynb) and [sample data](sample_data.csv)
- Run through the code and observe what each code block does
- Questions? Ask me!
