# Synthesis of basic python commands

At this point, you have been introduced to basic python structure including loops, conditional statemenmts and functions. Today we will delve into lists and then numpy for calculations. 
At the end of the class you will work on a coding assignment to bring all these iedas together.


# Activities

- Download the file [basic_python.ipynb](basic_python.ipynb) and run through each cell. Complete the excercise at the end
- Download the file [python_variables_intro_with_exercises_and_solutions.ipynb](python_variables_intro_with_exercises_and_solutions.ipynb) and run through each cell. Complete the excercise at the end
- 

- Upload your ipynb files on moodle. But first make sure that I have examined your code in class.
