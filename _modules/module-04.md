## Activity 1

- Review the code for your project from last class and run all the cells
  
- Ask any questions that may arise
  
- Since you were not able to upload your code to moodle, make sure to upload it by end of today's class

## Activity 2

- Quick coding practice with a new data
- Download the file tc_damages.csv from moodle (look under code and data section). This file reports the estimated damages (in from each Atlantic hurricane from 2003-2022.
- Write code that will (a) report the costliest and the least costliest tropical storm; (b) report the top 5 most costly storms; (c) draw a bar chart showing the total losses (annual total) per year.

## Activity 3

Today we will learn about making maps in Python.
