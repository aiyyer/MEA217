# Introduction to Python For Geosciences
Course Website: [python_for_geosciences](https://aiyyer.github.io/intro_to_python_for_geosciences/)
## North Carolina State University, Fall 2025

Instructor: Anantha Aiyyer

Time: Tues & Thu 11:45 am - 1:30 pm

## Course Overview
This course introduces geoscience students to computational problem-solving using Python. We begin with Karel the Robot to teach coding logic in a simple visual way, then transition into Python for real-world geoscience applications spanning **atmospheric science, marine science, and geology**. By the end, students will be able to process, analyze, and visualize diverse geoscience datasets using `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `xarray`.
